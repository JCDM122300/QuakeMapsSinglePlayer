# QuakeMapsSinglePlayer
My repository for my single player quake level (and possibly more levels if I get bored or want to learn more)
Map Name: Castle of the Damned 
Start Date: Nov 9th, 2021
End Date: Dec 21st, 2021
One of the first maps I ever created. A little short due to weird trigger constraints but it still came out a little better than I'd hoped.  If you want the repo for this here is the link: https://github.com/JCDM122300/QuakeMapsSinglePlayer
Thanks for playing! -JC Dec 21st, 2021
